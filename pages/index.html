                        Greetings and salutations! My name is Robin Hwang, and I currently study at the University of Michigan. My interests
                        lie in computer science and product management. I enjoy taking on leadership positions and steering a group with passion.

                        I am originally from New York, born and raised. I have lived downstate all my life. So far, I have to say that East Coast
                        life is far superior to the Midwestern life that I have been living in Michigan. Always subject to change, however.

                        It had to be around 2017 when I first started to develop and interest in computer science. I was always curious about
                        what could be powering my search engine (Google), my television, the games I played, and my cell phone. I remember
                        stumbling upon articles about circuits and hardware. Quite frankly, I wasn't really interested. I wanted to know where
                        the logic was happening and where the decisions were being made. After a little more surfing on the web, I discovered
                        computer science and programming.
                    </h3>
                    <h3 class="blue3 pb-5" style="font-size:1.2rem">
                        With the word "programming" at the back of my head, I decided to enroll in a programming course during my freshman year
                        of high school. It was called "Introduction to Programming With Python." Although it was an intro-level course, I learned
                        a great deal about the basics of programming and logic. My curiosity was piqued, and I decided to continue my computer
                        science education throughout the rest of my years of high school and eventually study it at the University of Michigan.
                        Which is where I am today.
